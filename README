= THE RUBYISTS.EU INITIATIVE

This initiative was born in late September 2009, when the Rock & Code [http://rock-n-code.com] crew realized how isolated European Ruby/Rails User Groups are (in every sense) and how this obstacle can be easily overcome by developing a communications platform that aims at integrating the Rubyists into a dynamic European core through the sharing of information and experience and through better cooperation and collaboration. As a member of the Amsterdam Ruby Group [http://amsterdam-rb.org] and as a founder of a company that occasionally sponsors Ruby events in Amsterdam, Javier Cicchelli shared our vision of Rubyists.EU with the Amsterdam Ruby group. At a certain stage, some of the Amsterdam.rb members volunteered to assist with its functional development.

== Mission

We strive to promote awareness, enhance assistance, and further boost cooperation and collaboration among individual Ruby hackers and Ruby/Rails User Groups throughout Europe.

== Vision

We dream that in time, by forging long-lasting bonds, European Rubyists could foster a sense of belonging to something bigger than their local Ruby communities.

== Message

United we stand out!

= PROJECT

This project is designed to be an extensible client-server architecture entirely built on Open Source technologies. The Ruby programming language [http://www.ruby-lang.org] and the Sinatra web framework [http://sinatrarb.com] have been chosen to be the main orchestrator due to its extreme flexibility, simplicity, and support for REST. The data repository of this project is the PostgreSQL relational database server [http://www.postgresql.com] and its interface provided by DataMapper [http://datamapper.org]. On the front-end side, HAML [http://haml-lang.com] and SASS [http://sass-lang.com] are the perfect tools for generating the HTML structure and CSS representation for the Website. Furthermore, the web interface is powered by the (in)famous Javascript language, JQuery [http://jquery.com], JSON [http://json.org],  and Google Maps API [http://code.google.com/apis/maps/]. Currently, the live version of the website is posted on Heroku [http://heroku.com] due to its easy setup and simple deployment.
