%p The advent of Internet has triggered a new age for humanity in which <em>constant change</em> and the gradual <em>disappearance of borders</em> are its driven forces. If we have to paraphrase Charles Dickens, this global information system has begotten “<em>the season of Light</em>” and it has given people the chance to live in “<em>the best of times</em>,” if they manage to harness its immense potential wisely. 
%p After 60 years of efforts toward the definition of an European identity, the now blurred geographic and cultural boundaries in our continent are slowly allowing people to become aware of their neighbors, and eventually to connect, form their own communities, and share and exchange information for numerous purposes.
%p In a wider sense, digital bonding and regional integration have given people a sense of belonging to a brand new world, where borders have become extremely fluid.
%p Inspired by the dream of <b>Europa</b>, we have decided to create a little hub that brings <em>Rubyists from all around Europe together<em>. Although there are numerous Ruby User Groups scattered all across our continent, very few of them are aware of one another’s presence. Such unawareness may limit communications, cooperation, and collaboration among Ruby nomads. This initiative, however, bravely aims at overcoming the obstacles, which beset the <em>development and adoption of the Ruby language</em> in Europe.
%p By joining <b>Rubyists.eu</b>, every Ruby User Group is welcome to add a layer of visibility to themselves. Enthusiastic Ruby hackers have the opportunity to <em>join new Ruby communities, share details about their regular group meetups, bring interesting events to the attention of others, announce special presentations, make groundbreaking Ruby advancements, or simply publish the pioneering Ruby projects they are working on.</em>
%p Hopefully, by forging bonds, <em>European Rubyists</em> could foster a sense of belonging to something bigger than their local Ruby community.
